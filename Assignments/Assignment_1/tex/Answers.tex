    \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
        \item See \texttt{report\_a.json}

        The model identifies the Koala, the Golden Retriever and the Ox in the zoo image correctly. Since the classes the network is trained on don't contain classes that fit the contents of the other images exactly, they are instead classified as similar objects or concepts. 
        Some of these are fitting, e.g. 'toyshop' for the image containing a lot of rubber ducks, others only vaguely resemble their actual content if at all ('Petri Dish' for the pacifier). It still seems like the model has recognized some broad concepts (flat round object) instead of choosing a class at random. 

        \item See \texttt{report\_b\_\{128, 512\}.json}

        Making the images smaller results in the model not being able to identify any of them correctly, probably due to lack of information.
        However, the model performance also deteriorates with larger images, which is probably due to it being trained on 224 by 224 crops of images resized to 256 by 256 (as seen in the documentation for the pretrained weights). The added information only confuses the model and the filters learned by the convolutional layers aren't the correct size for the larger images' bigger features.

        \item See \texttt{report\_c.json}

        Flipping the images vertically results in the same classification for images that exhibit some vertical symmetry. Other images however aren't classified correctly.
        The augmentations used during the training of the network likely don't contain any flips, so the network hasn't learned any invariances concerning orientation of objects.

    \end{enumerate}
